# How does this work? (Computational Thinking-wise)

Where does the data come from?
What do you think the data looks like?
How is the data used?
Where do you find evidence of the data used?

How does the app know, which object each list item is associated with?
	- Look at the inspector
	- Look at the index
	- Look at the js file, the data

Main point with this app demo is to try to understand the separation of concerns.
	- Data
	- Presentation
	- Controlling Logic

Data flows from data to presentation, presentation to data, and is manipulated between through the control. It isn't so important to learn all the specific function names (although these are all tools in your weapons box,) but to see how things relate as inputs and outputs to build the "bigger" thing.
