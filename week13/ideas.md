## Messaging Form

We need info from the user:
	- Who to send it to, general
		- More specific data about the sender
			- id
			- name
	- _Message Text_
		- _input text or textarea_
	- _Intent to send / save / post
		- button_
		- pressing enter
	- Timestamp
		- Where does this come from?
	- Location
		- Where does this come from?

We want people to type things in. When the button is pushed....
	- How do we access the textarea?
	- How do we get the data in the textarea?
	- How do we "save" that data?

	- _How to get the button to work?_
	- How to get the data from the textarea?

Create a visual display of messages
	- each time the button is pushed.. we're going to add a message to the chat log?
		- create an element
		- change the text of an element
		- append an element
